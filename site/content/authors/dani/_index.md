Daniel Azar is a Software Engineer working at the Microsoft Azure platform. His works include the VPN networking section of the Azure Portal and the Azure Email Orchestrator.

In high school at ORT I graduated with honors specialized in ICT. During it I stood out in different national and international competitions in mathematics and computer science. Then I studied Software Engineering at ITBA where I focused on graphic computing. My thesis was about the generation of algebraic surfaces in mobile devices. At 23, I formed a software factory. Then I participated in several innovative projects.

I am currently involved in 2 projects. Developing a crowdfunding platform in exchange for actions and the development of a new way to buy products online. I participate in two meetup groups, one on programming and the other on data dissemination.
